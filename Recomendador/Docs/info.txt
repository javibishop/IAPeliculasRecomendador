In machine learning, the columns that are used to make a prediction are called Features, and the column with the returned prediction is called the Label.
You want to predict movie ratings, so the rating column is the Label. The other three columns, userId, movieId, and timestamp are all Features used to predict the Label.
It's up to you to decide which Features are used to predict the Label. You can also use methods like permutation feature importance to help with selecting the best Features.
